ABSTRACT
================================================================================

Class B G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as GLP1R and PTH1R, are vital
drug targets. While injectable peptide drugs exist, oral small-molecule drugs
are still under development.

This paper reports:
- 2.57 A cryo-EM structure of human PTH1R in complex with Gs and PCO371
- PCO371 binds at an UNEXPECTED site: the cytoplasmic interface between
  receptor and G protein (entirely different from known ligand binding sites)
- This binding pocket is CONSERVED across class B GPCRs
- PCO371 is a G-protein-biased agonist (defective in arrestin signaling)

================================================================================
INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

Class B GPCRs are peptide hormone receptors targeting diseases like:
- Osteoporosis
- Type 2 diabetes
- Obesity
- Depression

Challenge: Natural ligands are large peptides requiring interaction with the
receptor's extracellular domain (ECD), making oral small-molecule development
difficult.

PCO371: A potent, orally available PTH1R agonist currently in phase 1 clinical
trials for hypoparathyroidism.

KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

1. PCO371 CHARACTERIZATION
--------------------------
- Full agonist for cAMP accumulation (similar to PTH 1-34)
- DEFECTIVE in beta-arrestin 1 and beta-arrestin 2 recruitment
- Therefore: G-protein-biased agonist

2. UNUSUAL BINDING SITE
-----------------------
- PCO371 occupies a unique horizontal U-shape pose at the INTRACELLULAR
  interface of TM2, TM3, TM6, TM7, and helix H8
- Interacts DIRECTLY with the alpha-5 helix of Gs
- Unlike peptide-bound structures, the ECD is invisible (flexible without peptide)

3. KEY MOLECULAR INTERACTIONS (PTH1R numbering)
-----------------------------------------------
Hydrogen bonds:
  - R219 (2.46b): H-bond with PCO371 head imidazolidinone
  - Y391 (Gs): Polar interaction with PCO371 head

Pi-stacking:
  - Y459 (7.57b): Pi-stacking with middle phenyl of PCO371
  - Y391 (Gs): Pi-stacking with middle phenyl of PCO371

Hydrophobic contacts:
  - I299 (3.47b), L413 (6.45b), I458 (7.56b)

Critical residue:
  - P415 (6.47b): ESSENTIAL for PCO371 binding

4. CONFORMATIONAL CHANGES
-------------------------
Compared to PTH-bound structures:
- TM6 extracellular end: 7.0 A INWARD shift (would collide with PTH peptide)
- TM6 intracellular side: 2.4 A OUTWARD shift (creates G-protein coupling cavity)

Three conserved networks rearranged:
- Central polar network
- HETY network
- TM2-TM6-TM7-H8 network

5. SELECTIVITY DETERMINANTS
---------------------------
PCO371 is highly selective for PTH1R:
- Does NOT activate WT PTH2R or GLP1R

Key mutations that RESTORE activity:
- PTH2R: L370F (6.47b) -> single mutation allows PCO371 activation
- GLP1R: L244I (3.47b) + L360F (6.49b) -> two mutations allow PCO371 activation

6. PAN-AGONIST ACTIVITY
-----------------------
PCO371 activates 7 OTHER WT class B GPCRs:
- GCGR (glucagon receptor)
- GIPR (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor)
- PAC1R (pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide receptor)
- GHRHR (growth hormone-releasing hormone receptor)
- SCTR (secretin receptor)
- VIP1R (vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor 1)
- VIP2R (vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor 2)

MUTANT ACTIVITY DATA (Extended Data Table 2)

PTH1R mutants with PCO371 response:

ENHANCING MUTATIONS (pEC50 > WT):
  V412A (6.44b): pEC50 = 7.49 (delta = +0.75) - reduces space constraints
  M414A (6.46b): pEC50 = 7.34 (delta = +0.60) - reduces space constraints
  F417A (6.49b): pEC50 = 7.14 (delta = +0.40)
  G464A (8.49b): pEC50 = 7.07 (delta = +0.33)
  L416A (6.48b): pEC50 = 7.01 (delta = +0.27)

WILD-TYPE:
  WT: pEC50 = 6.74

REDUCING MUTATIONS (pEC50 < WT):
  E302A (3.50b): pEC50 = 5.85 (delta = -0.89)
  L413A (6.45b): pEC50 = 6.01 (delta = -0.73)
  L226A (2.53b): pEC50 = 6.07 (delta = -0.67)
  I299A (3.47b): pEC50 = 6.09 (delta = -0.65)
  R219A (2.46b): pEC50 = 6.23 (delta = -0.51)
  H223A (2.50b): pEC50 = 6.31 (delta = -0.43)

CRITICAL (abolishes activity):
  P415A (6.47b): pEC50 = N/A (no detectable response)

BINDING POCKET RESIDUES (GRN positions from Figure 4)

CONSERVED across all 15 Class B GPCRs (same amino acid):
  2.46b (R), 2.50b (H), 3.50b (E), 6.45b (L), 8.47b (N), 8.49b (E)

VARIABLE (determines selectivity):
  3.47b: I (PTH1R) vs L (GLP1R/GCGR family) vs M (CTR/CRF family)
  6.43b: L (conserved in most)
  6.44b: V (PTH1R) vs T/F/L/I (others)
  6.46b: M (PTH1R) vs V/I/L (others)
  6.47b: P (PTH1R/GLP1R family) vs L (PTH2R) - CRITICAL
  6.48b: L (conserved)
  6.49b: F (PTH1R) vs L (GLP1R/GCGR)
  7.56b: I (PTH1R) vs L/F/Q (others)
  7.57b: Y (mostly conserved, F in CLR)

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

PCO371 identifies a NOVEL, CONSERVED intracellular agonist-binding site in
class B GPCRs. Because this site is far from the ECD, small molecules targeting
it do NOT need to mimic complex peptide-ECD interactions.

THERAPEUTIC IMPLICATIONS:
- New template for structure-based design of ORAL drugs
- Potential application to multiple class B GPCR targets
- Could enable oral treatments for diabetes (GLP1R), obesity (GIPR), and other
  conditions currently requiring injectable peptide drugs
